    "Biography": "Before I joined the University, I have been a school social worker, the in-charge of a children and youth centre and a family centre for a number of years. I joined the City University of Hong Kong as a lecturer in the Division of Social Studies in 1993, was transferred to the Department of Social & Behavioural Sciences (formerly Department of Applied Social Studies) as an Assistant Professor in 2008 and retitled as an Associate Professor (B) in 2012. I was promoted to Associate Professor (A) in 2017. My mission is to improve the mental health of children and adolescents from family ecological and positive psychological perspectives. My research mainly focuses on the family ecological and positive psychological factors that are related to anxiety, depression and suicide of children and adolescents. In the past years, I have published 50 papers related to children and adolescent mental health problems, parenting and positive psychology in international refereed journals with high impact factor, i.e., Child Abuse and Neglect, Prevention Science, Research on Social Work Practice, Journal of Advanced Nursing, Journal of Intellectual Disability Research, Journal of Happiness Studies, Nursing Research, Social Indicators Research, Suicide and Life-threatening Behavior, Child Indicators Research, Journal of Positive Psychology, Children and Youth Services Review, Journal of Child and Family Studies.  I was also invited as a guest speaker and a keynote speaker in about 60 conferences and symposiums. I have established the Positive Education Laboratory in 2015, aiming to promote positive education for the students, teachers, parents and the community. The laboratory has collaborated with about 200 local schools to launch positive education.\nFor the past years, I have implemented about 20 positive psychology projects to alleviate anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation, as well as to improve the psychological well-being of children and adolescents. The projects include: \u201cEnhancing hope and gratitude to alleviate depression in primary and secondary school students\", , \u201cDeveloping hope and optimism to decrease anxiety in secondary school students\", \u201cApplication of positive psychology for whole person development of pre-school children\", \u201cIntegrating positive psychology and elements of music therapy to alleviate anxiety and depression of students\", \u201cImplementing positive education to nurture wellbeing and enhance mental health of primary school students\", \u201cApplication of positive psychology to mental health setting \u2013 A holistic approach\", \u201cApplication of positive education to university students\".  Funded by Idea Incubator fund and based on Satir Therapy and Bowen Therapy, two board games and two computer games aiming to promote communication among family members and increase mutual understanding were developed in 2013. This project won the Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award by the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) in 2013. In addition, as the course leader, I got the Teaching Innovation Award (Team) for our innovation in teaching the CLASS foundation course awarded by CLASS in 2019. My students' projects also got the Discovery Enriched Curriculum Award in 2015, 2017 and 2019. I was presented the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the University of Hong Kong in 2020.\nIn the previous years, I got about HK$45,000,000 (US$5,800,000) from internal grants at CityU and from external grants such as MTR Corporation Ltd., General Research Fund, Public Policy Research Fund, Quality Education Fund, UGC teaching and learning related initiatives, Bei Shan Tang Foundation, Yan Tak Charity Fund Limited, contract researches from secondary and primary schools, St. James Settlement, Caritas Social Services, ELCHK, Wofoo Charity Fund, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, the Boys and Girls Clubs Association of Hong Kong, Mental Health Association, and the HK Rhenish Church Synod Social Services Department.

    "Biography": "Dr. Bernard Chi Yuen Chiu received his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Calgary, Canada, in 2001, his Master of Applied Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2003, and his Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Western Ontario, Canada, in 2008. He was a postdoctoral fellow in the Vascular Imaging Laboratory at the University of Washington, Seattle, until he joined the Electronic Engineering Department at City University of Hong Kong in March 2011.\nAtherosclerosis is the main cause of stroke. There is now agreement that the risk of stroke is related to slow progression, followed by sudden plaque complications, leading to plaque rupture and consequent life-threatening thrombosis. Most strokes associated with atherosclerosis, however, can be prevented by lifestyle/dietary changes, medical and surgical treatment. Therefore, the ability to monitor atherosclerotic plaque progression/regression as well as identify vulnerable plaque that is prone to rupture is important. Dr. Chiu's research is focused on developing cost-effective, sensitive and specific plaque quantification tools based on 3D carotid ultrasound (US) images. As carotid atherosclerosis is a focal disease that predominantly occurs at the bifurcation, he has developed a tool to measure plaque thickness on a point-by-point basis, resulting in a 3D map of plaque thickness. This method has been published in Medical Physics (Publication 8). He has further developed a 2D flattened representation of the map in order to facilitate the interpretation and visualization of the 3D map. This method has been published in Medical Image Analysis (Publication 9). In an effort to identify vulnerable plaques, he has quantified carotid plaque surface irregularity using local curvature of the plaque surface segmented from 3D US images. This work has been published in Physics in Medicine and Biology (Publication 6).\nAs a postdoctoral fellow in University of Washington, he has made a contribution in developing a semiautomatic segmentation algorithm for MR images of femoral arteries. This work has been published in Medical Physics (Publication 2). It is also at this time that he began to work on combining MR and US images in identifying vulnerable plaque (Publication 1). MR is a well-established imaging modality for plaque composition detection. However, it is not cost-effective to use MRI for routine screening of vascular diseases. US, however, can be used for monitoring large numbers of asymptomatic patients in a large-scale clinical trial. Therefore, a patient management strategy in which US is used in screening and MR is used in validating and diagnosis of vascular diseases will have a great impact in decreasing the risk of stroke.",

    "Biography": "Olli Tapio Leino is a computer game studies and philosophy of computer games scholar focusing on materiality, experience, emotion, interpretation, and performance in computer games and playable art.\nRecent publications\nHis recent publications include an article on the technological specificity and playful practice in Mahjong in Games & Culture (2017), an article on the neoliberalist underpinnings of computer games in Journal of Gaming & Virtual Worlds (2016), a chapter on romantic attraction to computer game characters in the Game Love anthology (2015), a chapter on ontology of gameplay in Springer anthology Philosophy of Computer Games (2012), an article on the technological specificity of single-player computer games in Game Studies (2011) translated into Polish by M. Nawrocki and published in Teksty Drugie 3 (164) 2017, and, into Chinese by Chen Ziyun (\u9648\u5b50\u8d5f) and published in Game Research Reader (\u6e38\u620f\u7814\u7a76\u8bfb\u672c) (2020) by Beijing Normal University Press, and a paper on computer game worlds recently translated into Brazilian Portuguese by I. Mussa & R Seula and published in Intexto 46 2019.\nGrants and Projects\nLeino and Dr Sebastian M\u00f6ring (University of Potsdam) are exploring the avenue of 'existential ludology', focusing on the methodological implications of the world-likeness of computer games. Leino's ongoing Hong Kong GRF-funded research projects include 'From Game Arcades to eSports Arenas: Understanding the cultures of competitive computer gaming in Hong Kong' (2018) together with co-investigators Dr. Sebastian M\u00f6ring from University of Potsdam and Dr. Yong Ming Kow, and, 'Ideas and Realities of Gamification' (2017), together with co-investigators Dr. Sebastian M\u00f6ring and Prof. Espen Aarseth from IT University of Copenhagen. His completed GRF project 'Existential Hermeneutics for Playable Media' (2014) focused on how technological materialities of computer games affect the conditions of experience, emotion, and interpretation in computer game play.\nLeino has carried out contracted research on public policy and eSports for Hong Kong Government (Cyberport) together with Dr. Yong Ming Kow and Mr. Chun Pang Yim of School of Creative Media. Together they form the Play/Work Research Group, affiliated with and funded by a three-year grant from City University's Applied Computing for Interactive Media (ACiM) Research Centre. Leino has also written about human/technology relations in new media art, and curated the 'New Playable Art' exhibition for IFVA'14 at Hong Kong Arts Centre. He has given invited speeches and keynotes internationally and is working on a book addressing questions of interpretation and experience at the overlap of computer games and playable art and media. He has been interviewed on the topic of computer games research for Radio and Television Hong Kong (RTHK), South China Morning Post (SCMP), Television Broadcasts Ltd. (TVB), and BBC Radio 5.\nTeaching\nLeino teaches courses on computer games and philosophy of technology, mainly for MA in Creative Media and MFA in Creative Media programmes. His courses include: Critical Ludology: Games, Playability and New Media Art, Analysis and Criticism of Computer Games, Philosophy of Technology and New Media, and Technologies in Art, Science and Everyday Life. He also advises both theoretical and practice-based student projects on undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral levels.\nAcademic Service\nLeino is a founding member of Chinese DiGRA chapter, a member of the steering group of the Game Philosophy Network, member of the editorial board of Journal of the Philosophy of Games and a member of the board of reviewers of Game Studies Journal. Leino was the Symposium Director and Conference Chair of 22nd International Symposium on Electronic Art ISEA2016 Hong Kong. At School of Creative Media, Leino has previously served as the Programme Leader of BA in Digital Media Broadcasting and currently serves as the Director of International Programmes and coordinates an international two-certificate Joint Undergraduate Degree Programme offered by City University of Hong Kong and Leuphana University of L\u00fcneburg in Germany.\nPrior to Joining CityU\nLeino earned his PhD from the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen in 2010 and MA from Faculty of Art & Design, University of Lapland in 2005. Prior to joining CityU in Spring 2010 he collaborated with Nokia in a research project on pervasive gaming, carried out contracted research for Ubisoft on multiplayer games and emotions, and was a visiting scholar at the Play Research Group of the University of the West of England and a resident at Pervasive Media Studio in Bristol, United Kingdom.

    "Biography": "Artist, theorist and curator, Maurice Benayoun (MoBen,\u83ab\u5954)is a pioneering and prominent figure in the field of New Media Art. MoBen's work freely explores the boundaries of media, encompassing video and virtual reality, perfume and sculpture, interactive art and large-scale public installation. MoBen's work has been widely awarded and exhibited in many major international museums including the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the museums of contemporary art in Lyon, Montreal, Seoul and Helsinki, Eyebeam and Museum of the Moving Image in New York, the Machida Museum, the ICC Tokyo, not to mention the permanent exhibition inside the Arc de Triomphe, Paris.\n \nFrom the Tunnel under the Atlantic(VR installation 1995) to NeORIZONand major works like World Skin, a Photo Safari in the Land of War (Golden Nica, Ars Electronica 1998) and the Mechanics of emotions, MoBen's work tries to exceed technology, exploring new ways of creating meaning through experiencing intense metaphorical situations.\n \nAfter his first exhibitions in Asia, ICC Tokyo 1999, he started developing the concept of \u201cCritical Fusion\" as a way to interrogate all fields of human activities at the artistic, economic and political level. Moben's first exhibitions in China was in 2005 while he simultaneously exhibited the first part of the Mechanics of Emotionsgrand \u0153uvre, converting symbolically the 700 sqm of 18 on the Bund gallery in Shanghai - into a luxury shop with e-Market, Emotional Market, and presenting a giant installation in the Shanghai Science Museum with Cosmopolisinstallation which attracted more than 10 000 people per day. This exhibition, one of the major events of the French Year, toured around China and was the opening exhibition of the 3 Gorges Museum in ChongQing, before being presented in Chengdu and Beijing. In 2008, NeORIZONwas a large-scale street installation on Century Avenue, Shanghai for eArts Festival. This experience in Asia was the origin of important mutations in MoBen's work and largely it motivated his decision to move to Hong Kong in 2012. On September 2014, MoBen co-curated with Jeffrey Shaw the Fleeting Light Large Scale interactive art exhibition including the first artist's work of the ICC Tower giant urban media screen by Jim Campbell. As an extension of this Urban Media Art curatorial experience, Benayoun started the Open Sky Project, on the 70 000 sqm media fa\u00e7ade of the ICC Tower, the highest in Hong Kong, inviting artists and MFA students to present their work on Hong Kong Harbour front. Most recent works include The Brain Factory, a conceptual interactive installation combining brain computer interaction, artificial intelligence and 3D printing. \n \nMoBen's work has won more than 20 international awards, including the Villa Medicis Hors les Murs, more than four Ars Electronica awards (including the coveted Golden Nica), Siggraph, Imagina, SACD and 4 International Monitor Awards. In 2014, MoBen was nominated for the Prix Ars Electronica Visionary Pioneer of Media Art award.\n \nMoBen is currently a Professor at the School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong and Chair of Graduate Studies Committee and PhD program coordinator.\n \nFurther reading: \nMaurice Benayoun, MoBen OPEN ART, Nlles Editions Scala, 2011 (monograph with 20 international contributors)\nThe-Dump, 207 Hypotheses for Committing Art, ed.

    "Biography": "Dr. Chu was born in Hong Kong and obtained his BSc in 1984 with Honors in Computing and Computer Electronics at the Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Canada, his MSc in Physics in 1986 and his PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1990, both from the University of Waterloo, Canada. His PhD thesis was Modeling of Guided-Wave Optical Structures by the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method.\nHe spent three more years at the University of Waterloo after graduation as Research Assistant Professor and as the lead researcher of the 'Modeling, Analysis and Design of Optical Waveguide Devices' project at the Canadian Institute of Telecommunication Research Centre. He was involved in the development of numerical methods for the design of optoelectronic devices, such as the FDTD and BPM methods, these methods were subsequently adopted by the industry as standard features in their simulation tools.\nIn 1993 he joined Professor Y. Kokubun's laboratory at the Yokohama National University as a JSPS Research Fellow and started his research in the fabrication of planar lightwave circuits (PLC). After a brief return to Canada as an Assistant Professor at the Wilfrid Laurier University in 1995, he returned to Japan in 1996 as the Associate Project Leader of the 'Three-dimensional micro-photonics' project at KAST, the project was funded by the Kanagawa Prefecture. A major accomplishment of the project was the development of high-index-contrast planar lightwave circuits and fabrication techniques. The technologies invented at the project find applications in optical communication, sensing and instrumentation. In particular, the seminal work on micro-ring resonators generated great interests from the research community and industry and it also resulted in over 30 publications between the years of 1998 to 2002.\nIn 1999 he moved to the US and spent one year at the National Institute of Standard and Technology as a Guest Researcher in the Quantum Process Group. In 2000 he co-founded Little Optics Inc. with his colleagues Brent Little and John Hryniewicz in Annapolis Junction, Maryland. This telecommunications company focused on development of densely integrated PLC for broadband applications and it invented the Hydex platform for optical integration. In 2004, Little Optics Inc. was acquired by ICxT-Nomadics, (ICxT-Nomadics [ICXT:NSAQ] was acquired by FILR System [FLIR:NASQ] in August 2010), and focused on the development of chemical and biological PLC micro-sensors. In 2006, as part of their integration strategy, Infinera Corp. [INFN:NASQ] acquired the Little Optics Division from ICxT-Nomadics to become their PLC Division. After helped Infinera on the development of the Hydex based PLC component and the deployment of these components in their DTN product line, Dr. Chu returned to his birthplace in the fall of 2010 and joined the City University of Hong Kong as an Associate Professor.",
